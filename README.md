Online Exam Proctoring and Management System

Overview

The Online Exam Proctoring and Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the exam process for both students and teachers. This system enhances the integrity of online examinations by utilizing advanced monitoring features while providing a user-friendly interface for managing exams efficiently.

Key Features
User Roles: The system supports multiple user roles, including teachers and students, each with tailored interfaces and functionalities.

Secure Registration and Login: Students and teachers can securely register and log in, ensuring a safe environment for all participants.

Exam Creation and Management: Teachers can create exams easily, with options to upload questions in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats. The system organizes exams by date, making it simple to manage upcoming assessments.

Proctoring Mechanism: The application employs a unique proctoring feature that monitors students during exams. If suspicious activity is detected, the system captures images and logs the incidents for later review, ensuring academic integrity without constant teacher supervision.

Live Monitoring: Teachers can view students' live streams during the exam, allowing them to intervene if any suspicious behavior occurs.

Suspicious Activity Alerts: The system automatically notifies teachers of any detected irregularities, enabling them to act promptly.

Exam History Tracking: An exam history feature records important information about each examination, including participation details and instances of detected suspicious actions, complete with supporting screenshots.















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
